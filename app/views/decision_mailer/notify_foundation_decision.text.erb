In the vote to form <%=raw( @organisation_name )%> as an Association held between <%=raw( @proposal.creation_date.strftime('%H:%M:%S') )%> on <%=raw( @proposal.creation_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d') )%> and <%=raw( @proposal.close_date.strftime('%H:%M:%S') )%> on <%=raw( @proposal.close_date.strftime('%Y-%m-%d') )%> <%=raw( @proposal.votes_for )%> people voted for and <%=raw( @proposal.votes_against )%> people voted against formation. 

<% if @proposal.passed? %>
The Association has therefore been formed with the following members: 
<% @members.each do |m| %>
<%=raw( @m.name )%>
<% end %>

<% if @member_vote and @member_vote.for? %>
You can now log in and manage your organisation at <%=raw( @organisation.domain ) %>
<% end %>
<% else %>
Therefore the Association was not formed. 

<% if @member.invitation_code %>
Select a password, then you can modify the constitution, invite new Founding Members and hold another Founding Vote at <%=raw( short_invitation_url(:id => @member.invitation_code) )%>
<% else %>
You can modify the constitution, invite new Founding Members and hold another Founding Vote at <%=raw( @organisation.domain ) %>
<% end %>
<% end %>

Thanks

<%=raw @organisation_name%>
