<%=raw( @founder.name  )%> has created a draft constitution for <%=raw( @organisation_name  )%> on One Click Orgs. 

They have invited you as a Founding Member. If you go to <%=raw(  short_invitation_url(:id => @member.invitation_code)  )%> you will be able to choose a password and access the draft constitution created by One Click Orgs. 

Once everyone's happy with the constitution <%=raw( @founder.name  )%> can call a Founding Vote to create the Association.

Thanks,

One Click Orgs
