http://github.com/emmapersky/one-click-orgs/issues#issue/118 "Update induction process to use interface closer to core app"

A new organisation is in a "pending" state until the founder marks it as "complete". i
In this state:
- the founder can modify the organisation/consitution without making proposals
- the founder can add new founding members without making proposals
- there is a prominent message that highlights this, and a button to finalise
- founding members can log in and view the consitution, but cannot make changes

Once the founder marks the organisation as "complete":
- Changes now require a proposal
- Members have full access to the system

http://github.com/emmapersky/one-click-orgs/issues/#issue/58 "Multi-org templating: allow the one codebase to support multiple types of organisation"

tbd. 

(For now let's do a quick implementation of #118 and use this to highlight more
detailed requirements for #58.)


 =====================
 = Induction Process =
 =====================

Member class: "founder"
Founder has all possible perms
Founder has new perm: "make changes without proposal"
Founder has new perm: "create proposal to found org"

Member class: "founding member"
Founding member has only one, new perm: "vote on 'found org' proposal"

new banner: "pending org" message, and "found org now" button
-> Confirmation dialogue
- create 'found org' proposal
- migrate founder to 'founding member' class' to prevent org changes

when 'found org' proposal failed:
- founding members can log in, view the constitution, will see a 'founding vote failed' message

when 'found org' proposal succeeded:
- all founding members who voted 'yes' or who abstained get migrated to full 'member' status
- all other founding members receive an email 'sorry that you don't want to be a part of this'
  - do we need/want to disable these accounts?
