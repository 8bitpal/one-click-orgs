Basic get-you-up-and-running instructions.

Requirements:

 * ruby 1.8.7
 * rubygems 1.3.x
 * a MySQL database
 ** mysql_config (as e.g. provided by libmysqlclient-dev on Debian)

on Debian:

 * ruby1.8-dev (to get mkmf.rb, which is not in the ruby1.8 package)
 * libopenssl-ruby1.8

Also note:

 * Merb.thor is broken with rubygems >= 1.3.2, cf http://github.com/wycats/merb/issues#issue/2


1. Grab the source:

$ git clone git://github.com/emmapersky/one-click-orgs.git
$ cd one-click-orgs

2. Install the necessary gems locally:

$ sudo gem install thor
$ gem sources -a http://gems.github.com
$ thor merb:gem:redeploy

3. Make a MySQL database for development, as described in config/database.yml.

4. Copy the sample local config file, and edit as appropriate:

$ mv config/local_config_sample.rb config/local_config.rb

5. Create default users (which also migrates the db):

$ ./bin/rake users:create

6. Start the server:

$ ./bin/merb

7. Visit http://localhost:4000/ and log in using, for example, username "emma@trampolinesystems.com" and password "oneclick".

8. To run the specs:

$ ./bin/rake spec

9. To deploy using passenger:

Install apache & mod_rails (http://www.modrails.com/) (the following instructions are for mac os x)

  1. add a oneclick.local to /etc/hosts, same line as 127.0.0.1
  
  2. install passenger gem (> 2.2)
    $ sudo gem install passenger  
    
  3. install mod_rails 
    $ sudo passenger-install-apache2-module
    
  This will compile the module for you, and give you some instructions how to enable
  the module. On my system, I created a new file /etc/apache2/other/passenger.conf with the following
  contents:
  
    LoadModule passenger_module /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/passenger-2.2.2/ext/apache2/mod_passenger.so
    PassengerRoot /Library/Ruby/Gems/1.8/gems/passenger-2.2.2
    PassengerRuby /System/Library/Frameworks/Ruby.framework/Versions/1.8/usr/bin/ruby
    
  4. copy config/passenger_config_sample.conf to /etc/apache2/other/oneclick.conf, and edit as appropriate
     (you'll need to change DocumentRoot and Directory)
     
    $ cp config/passenger_config_sample.conf /etc/apache2/other/oneclick.conf
    
  5. restart/start apache (System Preferences ➔ Sharing ➔ Web Sharing)
  
  6. Visit http://oneclick.local
  
  7. If it doesn't work, check the system log (using the Console app, /Application/Utilities/Console.app)
     or the apache error log (location of file defined in oneclick.conf, line starting with 'ErrorLog')
